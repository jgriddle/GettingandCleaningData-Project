# GettingandCleaningData-Project
Class project for Data Science course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The repo consists of a script file "run_analysys.R" as well as a codebook explaining the dataset generated.

The script file ingests a broad set of observation data from the UCI Maching Learning Repository and
outputs a reduced set of data averaged over the parameter space (Activity in this case). The dataset 
generated from the script file represents a set of observations recorded over a range of Activity types per 
subject for a group of 30 subjects. Each observation in the dataset include Subject number, Activity type 
and the mean and standard deviation a set of variables that were estimated from a set of kinematic measured 
signals. See http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones# for more
detail.
